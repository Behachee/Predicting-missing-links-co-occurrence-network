## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting missing links in co-occurrence networks using machine learning techniques. It includes implementations of various models and algorithms tailored for this task.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

""" git clone https://github.com/Behachee/Predicting-missing-links-co-occurrence-network.git""" 











The 3-page report should include the following sections (in that order):
feature engineering (30 points). Regardless of the performance achieved, intended to reward the research efforts, creativity and rigor put into feature engineering. Best submissions will capture both textual, graph-theoretical, and meta information available in the node_information.csv file. You are expected to:
explain the motivation and intuition behind each feature. How did you come up with the feature (e.g., research paper)? What is it intended to capture?
rigorously report your experiments about the impact of various combinations of features on predictive performance, and, depending on the classifier, how you tackled the task of feature selection.
model tuning and comparison (30 points). Best submissions will:
compare multiple models and approaches (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, GNNs),
for each classifier, explain the procedure that was followed to tackle parameter tuning and prevent overfitting.
Report and code completeness, organization and readability will be worth 10 points. Best submissions will (1) clearly deliver the solution, providing detailed explanations of each step, (2) provide clear, well organized and commented code, (3) refer to research papers.
